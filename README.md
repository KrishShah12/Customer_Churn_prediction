In this repository, we've conducted a comprehensive end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to delve into the intricacies of our customer data. By identifying key characteristics, we've gained valuable insights into the factors influencing customer churn. Leveraging this understanding, I've judiciously employed the insights to craft a robust Machine Learning model.

The primary objective of our model is to predict customer churn, providing us with the ability to proactively address and mitigate the reasons behind customer attrition. I've meticulously deployed the model on Streamlit, creating an interactive and user-friendly interface for seamless exploration and interpretation.

Customer churn prediction is crucial for any business, and this repository encapsulates our efforts to measure and understand why customers may choose to leave our services. Through the combination of insightful EDA, strategic feature utilization, and a powerful predictive model, we aim to empower our business with the tools needed to enhance customer retention and satisfaction.

Explore the repository to dive into the details of our analysis, model development, and deployment, and join us in our commitment to fostering customer-centric strategies.
